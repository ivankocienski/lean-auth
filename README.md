# Lean Auth

A really basic authentication template.

## why?

Devise is the go to auth system for rails, right? But when you find your project growing and you
need to get creative with the authentication system then the devise gem stops being this lean
black box and pours its unholy guts all over your project.

So instead of battling with devise to do a nifty 'access' page where the login and sign up forms
are on the same page (like reddit) i decided to hack my own.

## Caveats

This code was pulled out of one of my other projects and is very much a 'throw it up on github'
rather than a polished product. Having said that, I have used this code in other projects.

- It is not a gem, but maybe in the future.

- The specs are somewhat lacking

- There is most likely little fragments of the proto-project it was ripped from still in there.

## How to use this.

New projects

Just git clone and hack away. 


Existing projects.

Er, good luck. But if you're smart you can figure it out. There isn't much to it thankfully
